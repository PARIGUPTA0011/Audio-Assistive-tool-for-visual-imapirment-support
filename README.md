Object Detection For Visually Impaired
This repository contains the implementation of an object detection system aimed at aiding visually impaired individuals. The project utilizes YOLOv8 and Detectron2 models to detect objects, with a specific focus on Indian currency notes. The models were trained using a custom dataset sourced from Roboflow.

The findings from this research conclude that the YOLOv8 model outperforms the Detectron2 model in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
